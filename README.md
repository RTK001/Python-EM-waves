# Python Electromagnetic Wave Solver
A python project to calcualte the electromagnetic output of point-sources in a given domain.

## Getting Started
As the project is still under construction, the jupyter notebook prototype is recommended for using and interacting with the program.

## Testing
Included is an excel spreadheet used to test the output in 2 dimensions, for a fixed and limited number of elements. 
By setting the input parameters to match the excel sheet, the program can be compared (currently manually).

### Prerequisites
Python, with:
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Jupyter (for jupyter notebook prototype)
